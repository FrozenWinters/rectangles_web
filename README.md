# Anchored Rectangle Packing

## Description

This is a web app to visualise the anchored rectangle packing problem (see Dumitrescu, Toth [2012]).
Ideally this in itself conveys the statement of the conjecture and aids one in getting a feel for the problem.
Note that the conjecture refers to placemnts of rectangles which are allowed only to intersect along their mutual boundaries,
a restriction that is not currently enforced in this version of the web app.

## Usage

This web app should work on all recent Chrome and Firefox releases on all desktop platforms.

Click on the square to place points. Press and drag the green endpoints to extend rectangles. Once a family of rectangles has been extended, press the `Compute Area` button to get the proportion of the area covered. The various buttons in the `Console` box improve usability.
